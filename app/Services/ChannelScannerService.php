     * MOCK IMPLEMENTATION: Fetches new video links from a channel.
     *
     * In a real-world application, this method would:
     * 1. Use an API client (e.g., for YouTube Data API) to get recent videos from the $channelLink.
     * 2. Filter out any videos whose IDs are already in the $processedVideoIds array.
     * 3. Return an array of new video data. Each item should be an array like:
     * ['id' => 'video_unique_id', 'link' => 'http://youtube.com/watch?v=...']
     *
     * For demonstration, this method returns a new fake video each time it's called.
     *
     * @param  string  $channelLink  The URL of the channel to scan.
     * @param  array  $processedVideoIds  An array of video IDs that have already been processed.
